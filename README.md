This repository contains the implementation for an assignment from a second-year Technion Databases course.

For this assignment, my course partner and I were given access to a server, a username, a password, and a database. The database records provided can be viewed in the included CSV file. Our task involved developing a webpage that dynamically displayed the results of SQL queries. Additionally, we crafted supplementary pages allowing users to upload both records and files to the database.

Technologies utilized in this project include PHP (leveraged via PhpStorm), SQL, HTML, and CSS.
