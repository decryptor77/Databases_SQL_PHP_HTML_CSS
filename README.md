The files in this repository are the implementaion of a second year Technion Databases course assignment:

My course partner & I were provided with a server, username, password and a database.
You can view the provided database records in the CSV file.
We created a webpage that displayed the result of a SQL query & also contained links to additional pages we created that enable uploading records and files to the database.
We used PHP (PhpStorm), SQL, HTML & CSS.
