The files in this repository are the implementaion of a second year Technion Databases course assignment:

We were provided with a server, username, password and database.
My course partner & I created a webpage that displayed the result of an SQL query & also contained links to additional pages we created that enable uploading records and files to the database.
We used PHP (PhpStorm), SQL, HTML & CSS.
